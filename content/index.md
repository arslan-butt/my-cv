I'm a **Software/Web Developer** with a degree in **Computer Engineering**, based in **Paris, France**.

With over **10 years** of experience, I specialize in **PHP (Laravel/Yii), Vue.js, Nuxt.js, React.js, and full-stack development**. I have built **scalable SaaS and multi-tenant applications**, focusing on **efficiency, performance, and maintainability**.

Passionate about **continuous learning and innovation**, I also explore **DevOps** practices like **CI/CD, Docker, and cloud solutions** to enhance deployment and scalability.

I believe in the **power of technology to solve real-world problems** and am driven by the desire to **continually improve and innovate**.
